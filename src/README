Event statistic project for calculating statistics objects
	- test version, under development
	- free software

 - test event queue (as vector);
 - statistic evaluations: sum, min, max, mean, dispersion, math. expectation, std. deviation;
 - statistic parameters aproximation using Simple Moving Average algorithm;
	
Required:
	- C++ compiler (gcc, g++, ...)
	- UnitTest++ (for tests)
